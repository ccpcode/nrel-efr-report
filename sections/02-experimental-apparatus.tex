\section{Experimental apparatus}

The EFR is comprised of a series of horizontal and vertical pipes connected with 90 degree elbows as shown in Figure \ref{fig:efr-assembly}. The reactor is essentially a pneumatic conveyor where biomass particles flow through a long pipe with several bends. Dimensions and material information about the EFR apparatus are provided in Figure \ref{fig:efr-geometry}.
