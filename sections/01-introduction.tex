\section{Introduction}

This report provides an overview of the NREL entrained flow reactor (EFR) and associated computational modeling tasks. The reactor operates at fast pyrolysis conditions to thermochemically convert biomass into gaseous products. The EFR is part of the thermochemical process development unit (TCPDU) which was originally designed for biomass gasification where the EFR was used as a thermal cracker. An overview of the TCPDU system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tcpdu-system}.
